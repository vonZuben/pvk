/** Trait for representing bit flags

Use the [`flags!`](crate::flags!()) macro to create a type which implements this trait.
It is not recommended to manually implement this trait.

A type which implements this trait represents flags that **must** be **included** and **excluded**.
Please check the documentation for APIs that require a `Flags` implementor.

This trait is unsafe to implement because it **must** also be implemented consistently with [`Includes`] and [`Excludes`] traits.

/// ## Example
/// ```
/// use vk_safe as vk;
///
/// // These are memory type properties and heap properties that are needed for memory to be mappable
///
/// // memory type **must** include HOST_VISIBLE_BIT
/// vk::flags!(MyMemoryProperties: MemoryPropertyFlags + HOST_VISIBLE_BIT);
/// // memory heap **must not** include MULTI_INSTANCE_BIT
/// vk::flags!(MyHeapProperties: MemoryHeapFlags - MULTI_INSTANCE_BIT);
///
/// // Example of including both positive and negative
/// vk::flags!(pub Random: MemoryPropertyFlags + HOST_VISIBLE_BIT - HOST_CACHED_BIT);
