//! Vulkan flags (also referred to as bitmasks for FlagBits)
//!
//! ðŸš§ docs in progress
//!
//! Flags are implemented as structs that hold a single numerical value (depends on vk.xml, currently can be u32 or u64).
//! All bits are represented as associated constants. All Flag types also has a sibling module (just a module with
//! the same name in snake_case), which also exposes all bits as standalone constants. This allows the Flag type
//! bits of `SomeFlags` to be imported with `use some_flags::*;`.
//!
//! ## Type level Flags
//!
//! Flags can be used at the type level to ensure that certain properties are available. For example, the
//! [`map_memory`](crate::scope::SecretScope::map_memory) method requires the
//! memory to have been allocated from host visible memory that is not on a multi instance heap. This
//! is expressed with [`Includes`] and [`Excludes`] traits, which can be collectively represented
//! by a type which implements the [`Flags`] trait.
//!
//! Use the [`flags!`] macro to create a type that correctly implements [`Flags`], [`Includes`], and [`Excludes`].
//!
//! ## illustrative implementation example
//! ```
//! # mod example {
//! pub type Flags = u32;
//!
//! pub struct PipelineCreateFlags(pub(crate) Flags);
//!
//! impl PipelineCreateFlags {
//!     pub const DISABLE_OPTIMIZATION_BIT: Self = Self(0x00000001);
//!     pub const ALLOW_DERIVATIVES_BIT: Self = Self(0x00000002);
//!     pub const DERIVATIVE_BIT: Self = Self(0x00000004);
//!     // and more
//! }
//!
//! pub mod pipeline_create_flag_bits {
//!     use super::PipelineCreateFlags;
//!     pub const DISABLE_OPTIMIZATION_BIT: PipelineCreateFlags =
//!         PipelineCreateFlags::DISABLE_OPTIMIZATION_BIT;
//!     pub const ALLOW_DERIVATIVES_BIT: PipelineCreateFlags =
//!         PipelineCreateFlags::ALLOW_DERIVATIVES_BIT;
//!     pub const DERIVATIVE_BIT: PipelineCreateFlags = PipelineCreateFlags::DERIVATIVE_BIT;
//!     // and more
//! }
//! # }
//! ```

/** Trait for representing bit flags

Use the [`flags!`](crate::flags!()) macro to create a type which implements this trait.
It is not recommended to manually implement this trait.

A type which implements this trait represents flags that **must** be **included** and **excluded**.
Please check the documentation for APIs that require a `Flags` implementor.

This trait is unsafe to implement because it **must** also be implemented consistently with [`Includes`] and [`Excludes`] traits.
