/*! vk-safe provides a safe low level Rust API for vulkan

## ‚ö†Ô∏è This is still very much a work in progress
This library is going thorough a lot of experimentation to see how far the type system can be pushed to provide a zero-overhead safe API for Vulkan.
At this stage, only a few Vulkan APIs are implemented. However, this should be a good representation of what the overall API will look like when done.
i.e. the "tricks" currently used with the type system to make the API safe should currently be pretty representative of the final product, and from now,
simply a lot of work needs to be put into implementing all the actual Vulkan APIs.

# Getting started

At the outset, this API is meant for people who know how to use Vulkan, or maybe for those who want to learn Vulkan.
This API is meant to be one-to-one with the C Vulkan API, as much as possible. Exceptions to this rule should be documented
on a case by case basis. Getting started with this API is very similar to getting started with Vulkan in C. There are
many resources online, but a good start would be [Vulkan tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/).

## Example (bare minimum to get a Device context)
```
use vk_safe::vk;
use vk::traits::*;

// declare the Vulkan version we are targeting
// must satisfy Device version <= Instance version
// (verified when used together)
vk::instance_context!(InstanceContext: VERSION_1_0);
vk::device_context!(DeviceContext: VERSION_1_0);

// create a tag for the instance
vk::tag!(instance_tag);

// configure and create instance
let app_info = vk::ApplicationInfo::new(InstanceContext);
let instance_info = vk::InstanceCreateInfo::new(&app_info);
let instance = vk::create_instance(&instance_info, instance_tag).unwrap();

// get physical devices
let physical_devices = instance
    .enumerate_physical_devices(Vec::new())
    .unwrap();

for physical_device in physical_devices.iter() {
    vk::tag!(tag);
    let physical_device = physical_device.tag(tag);

    // discover queues on the physical device
    let queue_family_properties = physical_device
        .get_physical_device_queue_family_properties(Vec::new())
        .unwrap();

    vk::tag!(families_tag);

    let mut queue_configs = vec![];
    let priorities = [vk::QueuePriority::default(); 10];
    for p in queue_family_properties.properties_iter(families_tag) {
        if p.queue_flags.satisfies(vk::QueueFlags::GRAPHICS_BIT) {
            queue_configs.push(
                vk::DeviceQueueCreateInfo::new(&priorities[..p.queue_count as usize], p)
                    .unwrap(),
            )
        }
    }

    vk::tag!(device_tag);
    // configure and create device
    let device_create_info = vk::DeviceCreateInfo::new(DeviceContext, &queue_configs);
    let device = physical_device
        .create_device(&device_create_info, device_tag)
        .unwrap();
}
```

# üöß Scopes and tagging
A **key** concept in vk-safe is the use of [`tag!`](scope::tag!), which creates a [`Tag`](scope::Tag)
that uses an invariant lifetime trick to ensure different instances of a type (e.g. different Instances,
PhysicalDevices, Devices, etc.) are distinguishable from each other.

See the [`scope`](mod@scope) module for more details.

### Naming convention
Vulkan items (commands, structs, etc.) are renamed in vk-safe to follow Rust naming conventions.
Names from Vulkan are converted by cutting off the leading "Vk" or "vk", and then converting the
remaining name in-line with
[RFC 430](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0430-finalizing-naming-conventions.md)

### üöß Trait representations of handles
...

### Returning Result
All Vulkan commands that can fail will return a Result. There Err variant is currently
a placeholder dyn Error type. This should be changed in future to an Error type that enables
handling specific Vulkan errors more easily.

### Structs are read-only by default
Most structs have a thin wrapper with a Deref implementation to provide read-only access.
Some structs have more specific methods to provide safe access. Vulkan has many "Info"
structs that the user creates and passes to commands, which have appropriate constructor
methods to ensure valid usage. Some structs may have other methods for safely enabling
specific use cases.

### Enumerator commands use ArrayStorage
Vulkan has many "Enumerate" or "Get" commands which take a pointer / length for an array,
to which return data will be written. Said commands can also be used to query length of
data to be returned by passing a null pointer. In vk-safe, "Enumerate" or "Get" commands
take a storage type which implements the [`ArrayStorage`] trait.

### üöß AllocationCallbacks
Vulkan supports AllocationCallbacks mostly for debugging purposes. These are not currently
supported in vk-safe. Adding them will *most likely* be a breaking change, assuming that
parameters will be added to the respective `create_*` commands.
(e.g. [`create_instance()`](vk::create_instance) will likely have an allocation_callbacks
parameter added).

## VUIDs (implementation detail)
All Vulkan APIs have valid usage rules that must be followed. Each valid usage rule has a VUID (Valid Usage Identifier). For all v-safe APIs,
the relevant VUIDs are *manually* checked against the Vulkan documentation. To help ensure that all VUIDs are checked and updated with changes
to Vulkan, a [check_vuids] tool is provided for development purposes to help automatically include the VUID rules in the source code.

After the rules are included in the source code, vk-safe attempts to ensure all ensure the rules are followed by designing the APIs to make use
of the type system as much as reasonably possible.

Some things are too complex to express in the type system (or it could be expressed but be too hard to use), so `const` computation is used when
possible (a big example of this is with APIs that take image format, tiling, type, and related flags etc., which have many possible combinations
and only a subset of valid / sensible combinations). It is recommended to make use of the `const` computation when possible to reduce runtime checks,
and also get earlier compile time errors.

Lastly, some things must be checked at runtime with regard to information that must be queried from the system. As much as possible, the API is
designed to make the user perform the checks automatically simply by using the API normally, and the type system is used to keep relevant information.
This, way there should be no *real* overhead since the user should need to do these checks anyway when initially obtaining like memory properties,
and then API's can rely on the information stored in the types.

# ü§î Why I made this

The intention is to provide an API that is as close as possible to the C Vulkan API, while also being safe to use.
I wanted to make this for the following reasons:
1. to become better with Rust and Vulkan
2. to create an API that provides a combination of "low level" and "safety" that I could not find with other Rust Vulkan APIs
3. to create a safe Vulkan API that is as zero overhead as possible
4. to **experiment** with how far I can push Rust and the type system to create a zero overhead safe Vulkan API
5. to code as a hobby (I can only spend my own limited free time on this and progress is very slow)

## Other APIs
- [Ash](https://github.com/ash-rs/ash) is a true low level Vulkan API for Rust where everything is unsafe. **Ash is actually a big inspiration for features vk-safe, other than safety**
- [Vulkano](https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano) calls itself a "low-levelish API" and a "High-level Rust API" in the README. From my own review, it seems pretty low level. However,
Vulkano is far from zero overhead due to using thing like Arc, and performing potentially heavy verification for all API calls.
(normally people using the c API would use validation layers such as VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation during development, and then remove all validation in a release build, but
I am not sure this can be done with Vulkano since validation is built in as runtime checks). I want vk-safe to represent validation in the type system so there is no overhead.
- [Wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) is a high level API that works on top of Vulkan, and other graphics APIs. Since it is not exclusive to Vulkan, it cannot provide the low level APIs I want.
