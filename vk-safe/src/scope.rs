Scopes for unique object handling

All dispatchable handles (e.g. Instance, Device, etc.) implement all commands as methods on
a special **scoped** version of the particular handle. This is used to ensure different
handles are distinct.

This is because the Vulkan API exposes a complex parent child hierarchy, and
it must be ensured that "child" are resources only used with their respective "parent" resource
or "sibling" resources. In this regard, it is necessary to ensure that different instances
of a particular handle are unique from one another.

Use the [`scope!`] macro to create scoped versions of handles.

## Example
```
use vk_safe::vk;

// vk::scope!(instance1);
// vk::scope!(instance2);

// TODO, scope!() is being replaced with tag!()
```

/** Deref target for Scope<'_, T>

*This is an implementation detail and you are not intended to directly use this*.

Types which are only safe to use within a scope implement their methods through this wrapper.

#### implementation details
This is just informative, and not to be relied upon, as it could change. `SecretScope` is a
`#[repr(transparent)]` wrapper around a `T: ?Sized`, and a `PhantomData<S>`. [`Scope<'_, T>`](Scope)
implements [`Deref`] with `Target = SecretScope<Self, T>`. In this way,
`SecretScope` can only ever exist as a reference bound to the lifetime of a [`Scope`], and
the invariant lifetime information is captured in the generic `S` type parameter.

vk-safe APIs can ensure different handles have the same scope (i.e. have the same Instance
or Device parent handle) by using the same generic parameter `S`.

The main reason to use this instead of [`Scope`] directly is to allow a "handle trait" pattern (See
modules in [`dispatchable_handles`](crate::dispatchable_handles)), and [`HandleScope`]. The handle
traits have Deref with the scoped handle type as the Target. This allows the handle traits to
abstract the `scopedness` of the handles while being transparently usable as the concrete type.
`Scope` cannot be directly used because it has a lifetime, and we cannot write e.g.
`trait Handle: Deref<Target = Scope<'scope, ConcreteHandle>>` because `'scope` is not defined.
We cannot even use `for<'scope> Deref<Target = Scope<'scope, ConcreteHandle>>` because we get
`error[E0582]: binding for associated type 'Target' references lifetime which does not appear in
the trait input types`.

`SecretScope` hides the lifetime by using `Scope` as a generic type parameter. We can then write
e.g. `trait Handle: Deref<Target = SecretScope<Self, ConcreteHandle>>`, where `Self` will be
`Scope<'_, ConcreteHandle>` as the implementor of the trait. Auto-deref then lets us seamlessly
call the concrete handle methods; e.g. given
`fn mf_fn(instance: impl Instance<Context: VERSION_1_0>) { let pds = instance.enumerate_physical_devices(Vec::new()); }`,
the `Instance` trait implies `Deref` to some concrete instance type, which has an `enumerate_physical_devices`
method (see details about context and version in [`context`](crate::context)).

# Safety
`SecretScope` is VERY delicate. It is only ever sound to have an a SecretScope which is
created by dereferencing `Scope`. In this way, for some handle `T` and lifetime `'scope`,
the concrete type will ALWAYS be `SecretScope<Scope<'scope, T>, T>`, even though
`Scope<'scope, T>` is abstracted away as a generic parameter `S`.
