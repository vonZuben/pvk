- [x] fix Display implementations for extension emums (that have extension suffix)
        This also fixes all shorthand generation for enumeration variants

- [ ] consider how handles are passed in to functions and structs (somewhat inconvenient to need to manually get handle from handle owner)

- [x] consider how to incorporate VkResult into return type for commands
        made custom error type a way to convert Vulkan error type thereto
        change the Vulkan error type name to VkResultRaw and custom error type name to VkResult

- [ ] consider how to deal with "sudo" optional types, such as in VkWriteDescriptorSet

- [ ] build entry code for creating instance, and also build code for properly create Devices (load Device commands)
