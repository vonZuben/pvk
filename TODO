- fix Display implementations for extension emums (that have extension suffix)

- consider how handles are passed in to functions and structs (somewhat inconvenient to need to manually get handle from handle owner)

- consider how to incorporate VkResult into return type for commands

- consider how to deal with "sudo" optional types, such as in VkWriteDescriptorSet
